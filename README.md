# iNeuron Landing Page Design | Hackathon for Javascript live batch ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Technologies-HTML--CSS-orange)

Hello There,

I'm `Adnan Sarkar`. This is Hackathon project for my [Full Stack Javascript](https://ineuron.ai/course/Full-Stack-Javascript-Web-Developer) course. Where I designed this page from scratch using raw HTML & CSS. This design is not fully responsive, because at first, I prove to myself that I'm comfortable designing anything using raw HTML-CSS. It looks perfect on screen size `1920 x 1080`.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## üñ• Preview
`note:` please make sure the preview screen is `1920 x 1080`

## ‚è≤ Time to finish the project
